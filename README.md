cleboundaries
=============

Boundaries of Cleveland wards, current, and proposed, etc. 

some of the TODO: 
- find existing city of cleveland ward boundaries (SHP would work)
- finish drawing the boundaries for 2013
- load each, separately into tilemill
- make the tilemill projects for the streets baselayer. 
- 1. obtain census tracts with population inside them from http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-data.html
and then figure out how to include in the projects as WNYC did.
